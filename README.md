# React-Button-Component

It's the react Button Component in which different kinds of button are programmed in one file. The advantage is that, button can be used any where with the single Button declaration. 

Button Component is programmed in React typeScript and styling is done through Styled Components and Material UI.

In order to review the code on UI,

1- Create React App in local.
2- Clone This Code in "src" folder in react app.
3- Open Command Line Interface and run "npm install --save typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest" to inlcude the typeScript in the project.
4- After completion, run "npm install @material-ui/core" to include materail UI in project.
5- After that, Run "npm install --save styled-components" to insall the Style Components in project.
6- Run "npm start"

NOTE: In App.js, import the Button.tsx and use it with any kind of button ( defined in the component ) to reveiw e.g. "<Button kind="turquoise" ></Button>"

Happy Coding :)
